# Macred
This guide walks you through building a unique, customizable macro keyboard tailored for CAD workflows using a Spacemouse. This project combines metalwork, 3D printing, soldering, and a bit of coding—perfect for makers looking to enhance their workspace with something both functional and satisfying to build.

Both versions of the Spacemouse (wired & wireless) fit in this keyboard.

I hope you enjoy this project as much as I did!
